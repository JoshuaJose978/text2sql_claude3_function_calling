Here's how you can proceed to create an SQLite `.db` file using Python from the scripts available in the `oltp-install-script` directory:

1. Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples.git
Navigate to the OLTP Install Script Directory:
```
2. Navigate to the OLTP Install Script Directory:

```bash
cd sql-server-samples/samples/databases/adventure-works/oltp-install-script
```

3. Install Required Python Libraries:
You might need additional libraries to parse and execute SQL scripts and interact with SQLite:

```bash
pip install sqlite3
```
4. Create the SQLite Database and Tables:
Use the sqlite3 library to create the database and execute the SQL scripts to create tables and insert data.

Hereâ€™s an example Python script to achieve this:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite database (or create it if it doesn't exist)

conn = sqlite3.connect('adventureworks.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Function to read SQL script from a file
def execute_sql_script(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        sql_script = file.read()
    cursor.executescript(sql_script)

# List of SQL script files to be executed (based on the contents of the 'oltp-install-script' folder)
sql_files = [
    'instawdb.sql',  # Script to create the database schema
    'instawdw.sql',  # Script to insert data into the database
]

# Execute each SQL script
for sql_file in sql_files:
    execute_sql_script(sql_file)

# Commit changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

5. .Run the Script:
Save the script as create_adventureworks_db.py and run it:
```bash
python create_adventureworks_db.py
```

Important Notes:
Ensure the SQL scripts (instawdb.sql, instawdw.sql, etc.) in the oltp-install-script directory are in the correct order and contain the necessary SQL commands to create the schema and insert the data.
Adjust the script to include all the necessary SQL files in the correct order.
This approach will create an SQLite .db file containing the AdventureWorks database using the SQL scripts available in the oltp-install-script directory. If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
